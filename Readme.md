# Future features

* Enable placement of ships in fleet by player.

* When faulty coordinates are written by the player the games crashes. To avoid this a new feature would solve this problem by enableing players to rewright input until it's correct.

* Developing a AI opponent which is more effecient than simply putting out random coordinates on the game board.

* If previousley used coordinates are put forth again the game should notify the player and enable them to choose new coordinates. 



# Testing

## Python



# Unfixed Bugs

* If the coordinates are not written correctly the game crashes, the coordinates have to be with in the game board area (x 0-9, y 0-9).

* The game has no way of knowing if the coordinates have been used before or not.
